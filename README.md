# CS-255
The project was to design a system for DriverPass. Liam wanted a system (DriverPass) to register users, manage appointments for users, and offer packages, tests and classes to its users.

The best part of my design was the considerations for certain exceptions. I didn't go completely in depth into all the exceptional situations that this kind of system would encounter but I established a solid foundation for such exceptions to be considered and solved.

I would revise the User Interface section. I could have done a better job actually describing and theorizing the potential user interface elements and what functionality would be offered to various users.

The end users are the core of any system that is being designed. In this case, the user's needs were interpreted directly (somewhat). Since all the requirments came directly from Liam and his IT officer, the scope might have been limited to just their ideas. As users are allowed to participate and tests are conducted, the scope can grow as more feedback is received.

Adaptability is the most important thing I would say in approaching and analyzing software design. Things change over the course of a project, and over the course of a software's lifetime. To design and adequately analyze a system, you should be flexible and open to change while maintaining core logic and following protocols and procedures within reason.
